                      <h2>Empowering Students to Helm Their Own Learning</h2>
                      <p>
                        To encourage students to pursue their own interests and learning goals, I design creative and exploratory assignments that leave room for personalization. Time spent in the classroom or in section is powerful for student learning, as they have ready access to their instructor, TAs, and peers to pursue subject mastery and ask questions. However, after-class assignments, where students work independently or in informal small groups, provide an opportunity to personalize students’ education by encouraging them to pursue their own interests and learning goals.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In my classroom, when I assign readings, I generally offer students an opportunity to choose from multiple possible readings, and use class time to discuss and synthesize what they and their peers learned from the different readings. Outside of readings, I favor project-based learning, where students apply what they’ve learned during class to projects or mini-projects of their choosing.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Creating Community Within the Classroom</h2>
                      <p>
                        A common rule of thumb for college courses is that for every hour in the classroom, students spend about two more working outside of it – which means that most of their learning is happening after class ends! In my teaching, I believe that it’s critical to support students outside the classroom, and that the best way to do that is to foster community and peer support amongst students so that they can act as a resource to each other.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I lay the groundwork for these connections, by offering <a href="/teaching/sample_materials.html">in-class, discussion-based exercises</a> and designing assignments around student collaboration that explicitly encourage students to work together and discuss their work.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I also believe that students feel a stronger sense of belonging in the classroom when they feel empowered to bring elements of their identities and themselves into class. In the earth sciences, this can be accomplished by connecting course content with student experiences. While teaching a remote sensing course, I designed a <a href="/outreach/gee_lessons.html">classroom coding exercise</a> where students used Landsat 8 imagery to conduct a short analysis on how the magnitude and timing of springtime leaf growth varies across ecosystems. I structured this assignment to allow students to select study sites that were interesting or personal to them from anywhere in the world. Many students selected their hometowns or other places that held special value to them. This personalization engaged the students, but also enhanced their learning – the diversity of student backgrounds that was already present in the classroom produced a diverse dataset that enabled us to compare and contrast patterns of vegetation growth across a wide array of ecosystems and make hypotheses about what drove the differences.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Potentially the most critical component of fostering community is creating an inclusive learning environment, where students from all backgrounds and ethnicities feel respected and valued as learners and contributors. Classroom equity is a moral imperative. When students feel a sense of belonging, they’re empowered to show up as curious and confident learners, which makes for livelier discussion and more impactful learning for every student. Unfortunately, this environment rarely emerges in the classroom without effort from the instructor, which inherits the framing and challenges of an already inequitable society. For more information on my approach to equity in the college classroom, you can read my <a href="/teaching/dei.html">diversity, equity, and inclusion statement</a>.

                      <h2>Providing Students with the Knowledge and Skills to Be Lifelong Learners</h2>
                      <p>
                        In a world overflowing with information – some reliable, and some not – students’ greatest asset is their critical thinking and their ability to parse and contextualize new information. My goal as a teacher is to not just impart knowledge to my students, but to teach them the skills they need to be practitioners and independent thinkers, and to ensure that my students’ learning doesn’t end when the course does.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Fostering independent learning starts with strong information literacy. In my classroom, I emphasize not just students ingesting information, but comprehending and evaluating it and discussing how it fits into their current mental models. This is especially the case for academic literature. Any researcher can tell you that academic journal articles can be intimidating and opaque to the novice. However, students who don’t pursue a career in research still benefit from an understanding of how academic publishing functions and knowledge disseminates, as well as gaining critical reading skills for advanced, field-specific material. While I was a graduate student mentor with SARP <a href="LINK_TO_SARP.html">[SARP experience]</a>, I organized an afternoon workshop to teach my students to understand the connections between papers using the AI tool ResearchRabbit. One of my favorite emails I’ve received from a student was from a SARP student telling me that they’ve used skills they learned in that mini-workshop in their classes after SARP ended.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Equipping Students with Technical Skills for Academic and Professional Success</h2>
                      <p>
                        Technical skills empower students to take the knowledge they learn in their coursework and use it to make their ideas come to life. In the earth sciences, this especially includes GIS and coding skills. I emphasize technical instruction in my teaching, and model my instruction after the teaching methods pioneered by The Carpentries, a non-profit organization that uses evidence-based teaching practices to instruct researchers in foundational coding and data science skills. As a certified instructor with The Carpentries, I am trained in creating a learning environment that is welcoming and productive for novice coders.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I believe that everyone can learn to code – including students who would tell you that they can’t! Too often, coding instruction relies heavily on students coming in with substantial technical literacy. If you work with computers a lot, things like directory structures may come to you as second nature, but can be new to students who grew up using different operating systems. I’ve witnessed this myself – the first time I taught coding, I explained that a data structure was a “type of object” before realizing that that phrase offered functionally no information to my students!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This gap between instructors and learners can give students the false impression that coding is hard, or even beyond their capability. But that’s not true! I believe that good technical instruction isn’t really that different from other forms of teaching: the essentials are to emphasize mastery of foundational knowledge, provide students with opportunities to test their knowledge through formative challenges and questioning, and to offer opportunities for students to personalize their learning. For examples of my approach to coding instruction, check out the <a href="LINK_TO_GEE_EXERCISES.html">Google Earth Engine exercises</a> I developed for a class on remote sensing.
